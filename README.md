# pulms-pdf-maker

A simple extension that binds a download button to the currently viewing document on the pulms site, which doesn't provide any download button.

# üìù PPTX/PPT Downloading
On the platforms, PPTX/PPT files are presented as images, and direct downloading or converting them to PDFs is restricted due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies.  This repository provides a solution to circumvent this limitation by enabling users to copy the image links and then create PDFs on their own end.
## Firefox

You can get it from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pulms-pdf-downloader).
